### Data-Structures

Welcome to my data-structures folder! Here you'll find solutions to optimization problems utilizing tools like Queues, Graphs, Arrays, Trees, and more.

##### About

In this repository, I explore various solutions for data structure problems, algorithmic challenges, and other interesting programming concepts. These projects have helped me strengthen my understanding of fundamental concepts and develop efficient and optimized solutions.

ðŸŒ† [**`Merge Skyline`**](www.github.com/snowjacob/data-structures/merge-skyline/): The skyline of a city refers to the outline created by the collection of buildings when viewed from a distance. This outline represents the key points along the horizon and is formed by the left endpoints of horizontal segments. The skyline is represented as a list of these key points, sorted based on their x-coordinate, in the format [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]. The last point in the list always has a y-coordinate of 0 and signifies the termination of the skyline, indicating where the rightmost building ends. The contour of the skyline includes any ground area situated between the leftmost and rightmost buildings. This solution utilizes divide-and-conquer method.

ðŸ’Ž [**`Field Gathering Problem`**](www.github.com/snowjacob/data-structures/field-gathering-problem/): Assume someone is exploring a field of treasure but has limited time. In order to efficiently gather as much treasure as possible, you split the field into a grid marking each spot on the grid with how much treasure is in each spot. You're goal is to create a path for the gatherer from top to bottom in order to gather the treasure. The gatherer may only choose to move down, down-left, or down-right, and may not skip any spots or move backwards. The goal is to maximize the amount of treasure collected. This solution uses topological-sort in order to find the best path.
